"Happy Path" is the code name for ways to win the game.

The following diagram shows actions (green boxes) and desirable goals (black text) and how they promote each other (arrows).

Each green arrow will be a law which should be selected in order to win the game.

Each black arrow will be a positive influence which has to be implemented in the model between the laws and parameters.
